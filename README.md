hi :)
in this project, I made an order purchase application 
the main reason is to experiment with MongoDB using MongoDB Atlas
so I made a orders collection as well as a customer collection,
in this version, I made this collection separated in the order class i made a customerId variable 
and created an aggregate service that returns
a new document containing the nested customer object for each order object. 
using the lookup and project stage operations.
